1. Write a Java program to multiply a number by 2 using bitwise operators.

2. Write a Java program to divide a number by 2 using bitwise operators.

3. Write a Java program to determine the number of bits that are set to 1 in an integer.

4. Write a Java program to check if a number is even or odd using bitwise operators.

5. Write a Java program to set a bit in a given position of an integer.

6. Write a Java program to clear a bit in a given position of an integer.

7. Write a Java program to toggle a bit in a given position of an integer.
   
8. Write a Java program to check if a given bit is set in an integer. (i.e., if the bit is 1)

9. Write a Java program to extract the nth bit of an integer.

# Chapter 02 Assignments (Medium difficulty)

Here are some assignments for working with matrices (2D arrays)

1. Write a Java program that takes two matrices A and B and multiplies them using matrix multiplication. Print the resulting matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6}}

    B = {{7, 8},
     {9, 10},
     {11, 12}}

    Result: {{58, 64},
         {139, 154}}

2. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the determinant of the matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6},
     {7, 8, 9}}

    Result: 0

3. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the transpose of the matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6},
     {7, 8, 9}}

    Result: {{1, 4, 7},
         {2, 5, 8},
         {3, 6, 9}}

4. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and checks if it is symmetric or not.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {2, 5, 6},
     {3, 6, 9}}

    Result: Symmetric

5. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the inverse of the matrix.
Example:

    A = {{4, 7},
     {2, 6}}

    Result: {{-1.5, 1.1666666666666667},
         {0.5, -0.6666666666666666}}

6. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the rank of the matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6},
     {7, 8, 9}}

    Result: 2

7. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix.
Example:

    A = {{2, 0, 1},
     {0, 1, 0},
     {1, 0, 2}}

    Result: Eigenvalues: {1, 2, 2}
        Eigenvectors: {{0.707, -0.707, 0},
                        {0, 0, 1},
                        {-0.707, -0.707, 0}}

8. Write a Java program that takes two matrices A and B and adds them. Print the resulting matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6}}

    B = {{7, 8, 9},
     {10, 11, 12}}

    Result: {{8, 10, 12},
         {14, 16, 18}}

9. Write a Java program that takes two matrices A and B and subtracts them. Print the resulting matrix.
Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6}}

    B = {{7, 8, 9},
     {10, 11, 12}}

    Result: {{-6, -6, -6},
         {-6, -6, -6}}

10. Write a Java program that takes a matrix A and finds the sum of its diagonal elements. Example:

    A = {{1, 2, 3},
     {4, 5, 6},
     {7, 8, 9}}

    Diagonal sum: 15

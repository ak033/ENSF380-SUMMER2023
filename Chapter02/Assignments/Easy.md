# Chapter 02 Assignments (Easy difficulty)

Here are some easy Java 17 programming assignments that focus on structural programming:

1. Write a program that prompts the user for their name and then prints "Hello, [name]!" to the console. Sample input: "John".

2. Write a program that reads in an integer from the user and then prints out whether it is odd or even. Sample input: 5. Sample output: Yes, it is odd. 

3. Write a program that reads in a positive integer from the user and then prints out all of its factors (excluding 1 and itself).

4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then prints out the string in reverse order. Sample input: "Hello, world!". Sample output: "!dlrow ,olleH"

5. Write a program that reads in a list of integers from the user and then prints out the sum and average of the list. Sample input: 5, 10, 15, 20.

6. Write a program that reads in a positive integer n from the user and then prints out the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Sample input: 7.

7. Write a program that reads in a list of integers from the user and then prints out the largest and smallest values in the list. Sample input: 3, 7, 1, 8, 4.

8. Write a program that reads in a positive integer from the user and then prints out whether it is prime or composite. Sample input: 17. Sample output: Yes, it is prime. 

9. Write a program that reads in a list of integers from the user and then prints out the median value in the list. Sample input: 5, 2, 9, 10.  Sample output: The median is 7. 

10. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings and then prints out whether they are equal (ignoring case). Sample input: "hello" and "HELLO".
